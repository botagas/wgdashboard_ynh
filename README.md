## Disclaimers / important information

### WireGuard Integration

This package automatically installs and configures WireGuard if not already present. It's designed to coexist peacefully with other WireGuard packages (like the dedicated `wireguard_ynh` package) using ACL-based permissions instead of conflicting ownership.

### Automated Setup

Upon installation, WGDashboard is automatically configured with:
- Uses the selected YunoHost admin user for login
- Option to provide custom password during installation, or auto-generates one
- Disabled TOTP/2FA by default (can be enabled later)
- Credentials displayed during installation and stored in app settings

### Admin Access

After installation, you can access your WGDashboard with:
- **Username:** Your selected YunoHost admin user
- **Password:** Custom password if provided, or auto-generated (shown during installation)

You can retrieve your credentials later using: `yunohost app setting wgdashboard wg_password`
